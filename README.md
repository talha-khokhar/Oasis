# Code-Case
The provided code represents the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a portfolio website. Let's break down the key components and functionality of the portfolio project:

HTML Structure:
The HTML document starts with the usual document type declaration and sets the language to English.
Meta tags are included for character set and viewport settings to ensure proper rendering on various devices.
External dependencies, such as the Font Awesome icon library and a custom CSS file, are linked.
The website is divided into sections: Header, About, and Contact.
Header Section:
The header section features a background image with the navigation menu and a prominent text block.
The navigation menu includes a logo, home, about, and contact links. The menu is responsive, with a hamburger icon for mobile devices.
About Section:
The about section contains information about the developer, including an image, a brief description, and tabs for displaying skills, experience, education, and certifications.
Each tab contains relevant details about the developer's skills and background.
Contact Section:
The contact section displays contact information, social media icons, and a form for users to submit messages.
The form utilizes JavaScript to send form data to a Google Sheet for processing.
CSS Styling:
The CSS file contains styling rules for various elements throughout the website.
Responsive design is implemented using media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.
FontAwesome icons are used for visual elements, such as menu icons and social media links.
JavaScript Functionality:
JavaScript functions are employed for handling tab switching in the about section, opening and closing the mobile menu, and submitting the contact form.
The code utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicks on tabs and buttons.
